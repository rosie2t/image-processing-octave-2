# image-processing-octave-2
📌 Overview:
This repository contains my second university project on Digital Image Processing, implemented using GNU Octave. The project explores various image processing techniques, including edge detection, compression, and feature extraction. The corresponding report explains the methodology, results, and conclusions.
